About this project
Introduction: As an analytics Consultant tasked with crafting a data-driven strategy for opening a new coffee shop, I delved into the "Great American Coffee Taste Test" dataset, consisting of survey responses from approximately 4,000 Americans after participating in a blind coffee taste test. This unique experiment, spearheaded by YouTube coffee expert James Hoffmann and Cometeer, aimed to provide a consistent tasting experience for participants nationwide. Leveraging this rich dataset, I have conducted a thorough analysis to uncover insights that will inform strategic decisions for our investors venturing into the US coffee market.

Goals:

Identify the target audience for the new coffee shop based on preferences revealed in the taste test.
Determine optimal product offerings, including coffee beans and drinks, to cater to customer preferences.
Develop a pricing strategy that aligns with customer value perception, maximizing revenue potential.
Provide additional insights and recommendations to guide the investors in establishing a successful coffee shop venture.
Business Needs: The investors seek to capitalize on the burgeoning US coffee market by leveraging data-driven insights to ensure a competitive edge in their new venture. With consumer preferences constantly evolving, understanding the intricacies of customer tastes, product preferences, and pricing perceptions is paramount to crafting a successful strategy for their coffee shop.
